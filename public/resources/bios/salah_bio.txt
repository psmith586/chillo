My name is Salah Ali, and I am currently attending San Francisco State University pursuing a major in Computer Science
 with a passion for technology. I have grown to become obsessed with the field of computer science.
Iâ€™m interested in learning more and more about web development and in the past I have gained skills in programming
 languages such as html, css, JavaScript, and java. My hobbies include reading interesting books, playing sports,
  and discovering and learning more and more about computer science.
