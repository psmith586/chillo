It is my 2 nd year at San Francisco State and it has been going well so far. I will graduate in spring
2021 if everything goes as planned. I am from Nepal, small country in between India and China.
I play sports like Soccer, Cricket, Basketball and Volleyball for fun. Both of my parents have
been my biggest supporter in my life. I was planning to visit them in this summer but had to
cancel with everything going around in the world nowadays.
