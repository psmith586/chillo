I am Valdemar Puente-Gonzalez and currently a senior at San Francisco State University working towards my bachelorâ€™s
 in computer science. My road towards achieving my degree did not start early. After High School I joined the Army
  helped in combating the war on terrorism. Doing tours to both Iraq and Afghanistan. It was there I learned valuable
   life skills that I still use to this day. After my time in the service I began my road towards higher education.
    Starting at City College of San Francisco where I balanced both work and study. Until I transferred to State College
     doing the same and building up my skills in programming and building a network of friends. When not working or
      studying for classes I enjoy gaming with friends only, going to the gym, and volunteering at local cat rescues.
