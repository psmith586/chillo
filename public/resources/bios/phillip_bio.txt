USMC Veteran. Computer Science Student. Problem Solver.

I started learning to code on my own after leaving the Marine Corps to start college.
I grew to love it and have since improved my skills in both fullstack development and 
problem solving. I look forward to bringing my talents and perspective to a team of innovators.
